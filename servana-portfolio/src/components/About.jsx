        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
It began with a question
Why is it so hard to find someone trustworthy when you need them most? Families across Nairobi faced the same frustrations — unreliable workers, safety concerns, and inconsistent service.
<br /><br />
Born in Nairobi
We started in one of Nairobi’s vibrant residential estates, Nyayo Estate, listening to the needs of households who wanted more than just a quick fix — they wanted trust, care, and reliability.
<br /><br />
The Spark
From that challenge came an idea: build not just another app, but a trusted ecosystem where families feel secure and service providers feel empowered.
<br /><br />
The Movement
Servana is more than a marketplace. It’s a movement of vetted professionals, seamless technology, and communities strengthened through trust and care.
<br /><br />
The Future
Our story is still unfolding. With every home we serve, we move closer to a world where convenience meets reliability, and where communities across Africa thrive together.
<br /><br />
“Servana: Built on trust. Growing with communities.”
